# ðŸ“– LSTM Next Word Predictor

A simple Streamlit web application that predicts the **next word** in a sequence using a pre-trained LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Predicts the next word given a short text input.
- Uses a pre-trained LSTM model stored in `.h5` format.
- Streamlit interface for interactive use.
- Tokenizer loaded from a `.pickle` file for consistent preprocessing.
